client sends
	{"type":0,"timestamp":1608351939,"query":"how to purchase","options":["ebay","google"],"maxAnswers":1}
	
server is waiting for a thing so it's accepted
server then broadcasts
	{"type":0,"timestamp":1608351939,"query":"how to purchase","options":["ebay","google"],"maxAnswers":1}
keep in mind timestamp is the same to make sure all client are synced up

clients will then send
	{"type":1,"choices":[2]}
or, if multiple,
	{"type":1,"choices":[2,1,...,3]}

server will then store user's vote in a map
when a handle is dropped, it gets removed from the map
this could also be ip based but it doesn't really matter for the scope of this

vote is checked to be good
server then broadcasts
	{"type":2,"tallies":[0,0,1]}
these are total counts of all the votes, serverside
that way every client is synced up

after vote is over
server then broadcasts
	{"type":3,"winner":2,"votes":1}
this is the end packet, query is then opened for anyone again
obviously people can just unhide the div but the server will completely ignore the packet if it gets sent while a vote is underway
